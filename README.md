## Project Structure

```text
ReadingTracker/
├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── shelf.html
│   ├── notes.html

│   ├── styles.css
│   └── assets/

```

The current frontend pages are located in `frontend/`. The root `index.html` redirects to the dashboard page for easier opening and deployment. The `backend/` folder is prepared for the future Django implementation.

## Run Locally

From the project root:

```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Shelf: `http://localhost:8000/shelf.html`
- Notes: `http://localhost:8000/notes.html`
- Vocabulary: `http://localhost:8000/vocabulary.html`
